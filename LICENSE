CODE LICENSES
=============

All program parts written in Rust in this project are licensed under the
AGPL-v3.0 or later. See LICENSE-AGPL-3.0 for the full text.
Except the 'technomancy_core' crate, which is licensed under the GPL-v3.0.
See LICENSE-GPL-3.0 for the full text.

Card decks loaded at runtime by technomancy_engine are complex data
structures read by the library and the larger game engine, and thus form part
of a combined work based on this library and engine. Thus, the terms and
conditions of the AGPL cover the whole combination.

As a special exception, the copyright holders of technomancy_engine give you
permission to load such card decks at runtime, regardless of the licence on the
decks, without having the provisions of AGPL s13 apply to the card decks. If
you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of the
library, but you are not obliged to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete
this exception statement from your version.

DOCUMENTATION LICENSES
